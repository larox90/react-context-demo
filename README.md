# TESTING THE CONTEXT FUNCTIONALITY IN REACT P1.

In this application we made a quick test in order to see how the _Context functionality_ works in React, we have mainly two folders, one called context, here we will define each of the context we need to use around our application.

the other folder is components, here we created 4 components, GrandParent that is used at App level, inside of _GrandParent_ we have Parent component, and inside of the _Parent_ component we have 2 children.

this test is to show that even our data is in the context file we can use it doesn't matter how down is out component.

in this example _Child_ component has a table with the posts and each post has a button to delete one post, when we delete one, the context info is updated and every component that is using this context will be updated automatically.

In the _ChildContent_ we are showing that because, there we have just a counter of the posts we already have, so whe we delete a post in the Child component this info is updated in ChildCounter component as well.

for more details about the components functionality read the README.md that you can find in the _components folder_.

in the context folder it's where we define the logic and the structure for this context information

for more details about the context functionality read the README.md that you can find in the _context folder_.

the place where we are wrapping our application is inside of the _index.js_ file, there you will find how to wrap the application with our context provider

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
